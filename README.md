# MTA Turstile Data

This was my first project for the Metis data science bootcamp. I investigated MTA turnstile data looking for patterns in subway station traffic. I was particularly curious about off-peak hours and focused on nighttime traffic to make comparisons between weeknights and weekends. You can read more about this project on [my blog](http://emschuch.github.io/MTA-Turnstile/).

The main goals for this project were to get more comfortable with Python, as well as with data cleaning and debugging.
